<h1>Carve Connect</h1>
  This is a social platform for action sport athletes and those who film them. This project set out to solve two problems. Action sport enthusiasts who want to reach the next level donâ€™t have the infrastructure typical sports (football, baseball, etc.) have. They need to build their own brand and they do that with film and other content to showcase their skills in order to get sponsored. Meanwhile, potential filmmakers need to produce content in order to build a successful portfolio, however they lack the means to reach out to a community who desperately wants pictures/film. Our platorm aims to faciliate the connection between both groups while providing an engaging social enviornment around it. This is Carve Connect.
